# CS210-Project-3

Q1: Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project is focused on integrating the Python and C++ Computer languages to create a program that tracks grocery items based on reading and writing input lists.
  
Q2: What did you do particularly well?
  I believe I made the program user-friendly, while also minimizing main in the C++ side of the program. I also validated all user input including input mismatch.
Q3: Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I am in charge of inventory management at my place of employment where I have worked with a similar system. With this program you could create a dictionary on the
  Python side to assign the item price to each item on the input file. Doing so will also help the client track revenue and advance plans on earning profit.
Q4: Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I think creating the Histogram was the most challenging aspect to write code for, mainly because I believe Python was better equipped for this step. Actually,
  I wrote the Histogram in Python first while using 5 lines. With C++, I had to use a delimiter and data type cast some variables to 
  produce the character I wanted in my program. While I would say it wasn't overly challenging, it took more time to code because I used C++ for this step.
Q5: What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I think polishing the skills we had learned previously in the course will be transferable to nearly any program, though the main skill learned from this program is 
  Computer Language Integration. It was valuable to see how the strengths of each Computer Language can contribute to a powerful program.
Q6: How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I used appropriate white space and naming conventions to made the code readable. I also used functions and strayed away from hard coding so the code can be adapted
  and maintained.
